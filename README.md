# Writing Buddy

WRITING BUDDY is an AI powered collaborative writing tool, served as a Discord Bot, and as a React App. DEMO VIDEO AND LINK TO ADD THE BOT TO YOUR SERVER SOON.

## How It Works/Tech Stack

### Model

The text is generated at a character-level, using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), built on Keras/TensorFlow. Following the recurrent layer are a few dense layers with a Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU) activation function, and regularized by batch normalization.

### Data/Preprocessing

The dataset is comprised of 153 short stories, scraped from [Classic Shorts](www.classicshorts.com/bib.html) using BeautifulSoup. It contains 3422389 characters and 611454 words, which ultimately amounts to 855649 training examples for the neural network.

The dataset was divided into input strings, and output charactersâ€”the character immediately after the input string. The data is encoded using one hot encryption.

### Webapp

The text prediction is served as a Flask server, which is served to the end-user through a Discord Bot, or a ReactJS frontend.

## Limitations

Ultimately, the project is more of a proof-of-concept, than a polished, viable solution for authors. Although the text generates correct English words and generally uses correct grammar, it still struggles to maintain a cohesive thought, and can sometimes get stuck in "word loops". It also has phrases/ words that it frequents, such as "country", "consul", and "sun".

These limitations are a product of both the small training data provided, as well as its character-level text generation. Word-level text generation with word embeddings/vectors may be more effective, but requires a larger dataset than we had on hand.
