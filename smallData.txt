i am happy to assure you that your anxiety is without reason. flemming will be confined to the sofa for three or four weeks, and will have to be careful at first how he uses his leg. a fracture of this kind is always a tedious affair. fortunately the bone was very skilfully set by the surgeon who chanced to be in the drugstore where flemming was brought after his fall, and i apprehend no permanent inconvenience from the accident.
